Here i am again, with another little project!

I've decided to create a Temperature Converter:
this website can convert Celsius to Fahrenheit,
and viceversa.

The site use 2 functions:

one for the conversion between the two different
units, and the other for the input field reset.

I styled it a little with some pastel color palette,
and imported a font from GoogleFonts, added the logo
and pushed it on GitHub :)
